Development Directory
=====================

This directory contains all source code, build files, etc.

Compiled classes are packed into jars that are placed into the Integration directory (../int).

All build operations are done using gradle:

    - gradle clean
    - gradle assemble
    - gradle jars

Gradle should be installed locally and accessible from the command line (we don't use Gradle Wrapper).
